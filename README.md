It is a web-based project that uses React.js as a library for implementing the front-end, Firebase for the backend, and Flusk as a software archaticture.  The link to the game is : https://collectingstonegame.web.app/

The game can be played offline with the AI, which I implement with Decision Tree algorithm, or online with up to 3 friends.

The game is about collecting four stones, and the first player who places four stones i nthe fields is the winner. Besides trying to place the stones, the players can protect their stones by shield while trying to destroy or steal opponents' stones or shields.
